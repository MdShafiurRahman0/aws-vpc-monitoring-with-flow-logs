# AWS VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs


# Get Ready To Build: 

1. ‚òÅÔ∏è Set up two VPCs and test their peering connection.
 
2. üõ∂ Set up VPC Flow Logs that collect network traffic data.

3. üß† Analyse network traffic using CloudWatch's Log Insights.

## 1. IPv4 CIDR block muust be 10.2.0.0/16

## Same as VPC-1



# Step 3: Launch EC2 Instances

1. Select Launch instances.
2. Since your first EC2 instance will be launched in your first VPC, let's name it 
3. For the Amazon Machine Image, select Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
4. For the Instance type, select t2.micro.
5. For the Key pair (login) panel, select  Proceed without a key pair (not recommended).

# Step 11: Update Route Tables

1. Set up a way for traffic coming from VPC 1 to get to VPC 2.
2. Set up a way for traffic coming from VPC 2 to get to VPC 1.


## Update VPC 1's route table

1. Scroll down and click on the Routes tab.

2. Click Edit routes.

3. . Let's add a new route!

4. Add a new route to VPC 2 by entering the CIDR block 10.2.0.0/16 as our Destination.

5. Under Target, select Peering Connection.

6. Select VPC 1 <> VPC 2.

## Update VPC 2's route table


## 1. The Destination is the CIDR block 10.1.0.0/16


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1100185c-c4d4-4fbe-986f-ac10524b0a76)


2. Revisit the EC2 Instance Connect tab that's connected to NextWork Public Server.
3. Woah! Lots of new lines coming through in the terminal.
